	<p> This <strong>Portfolio Website</strong> discusses a brief personal biography and achievement. 
		My name is Daniel Thongbor. I was born in Juba, South Sudan in Africa. Over twenty years ago, 
		I came to the United States from Kakuma Refugees Camp in Kenya as one of the Lost Boys of Sudan. 
		I was truely humbled and most appeciative to both the United States government and the Catholic 
		Social Services for bringing my colleagues and I to this great country. I am now resided in 
		Charlotte, North Carolina (NC).</p>
	<p> After we arrived to Charlotte, NC, we started the processes of getting immigration documents,
		finding jobs, and enrolling in the community colleges and universities. I received my US citizenship 
		in 2007 and acquired some school documents. These school documents encompass <em>Science, International 
		Studies, Cloud Computing Architecture</em>, and current <em>Full Stack Programming.</em></p>
